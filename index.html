				<h3>About me</h3>
					<p>I enjoy reading, hiking, biking, roller blading, baking, eating, gaming, laughing at myself, laughing <strike>at</strike> with others, and traveling. I've been an amateur photographer for over 20 years. I grew up outside Chicago until I was 8 when my family transferred to the Atlanta area. I married my high school sweet heart, and we lived in beautiful Boulder, Colorado from August 2015 through September 2016. We have 2 rescue dogs and a pet snake named Severus. I'm a huge fan of Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars. I've put countless hours into Skyrim and Civilization V. I've been to Ireland, Japan, and have road tripped up the Northeast coast and out West.</p>
					<p>I consider my personality laid back but serious when needed. I kid you not, in second grade I was given a certificate for "Most Responsible". I still have it tucked away in storage. Although I hold myself accountable, I always have fun even during the most stressful of times. My father was a polypropoline technician, and my mother a kitchen designer; I've inherited both the technical and creative sides. I love working in collaborative environments, but also work well on my own, including when I worked remotely for half a year. I have had the privelage of learning from fantastic mentors, and to train and inspire fellow colleagues. I thoroughly enjoy the not-so-popular task of documentation. I understand the importance of filling an open role with someone who is the right fit. It's mutual. Please do get in touch if you feel I could be a contributing member of your team!</p>
